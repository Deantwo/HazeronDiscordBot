# HazeronDiscordBot
A Discord bot for Shores of Hazeron Discord servers.

A basic Discord bot written in C# with the [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) library.

The bot can theoretically support multiple servers, so if/when proper hosting is found it could be made public and used by multiple Discord servers.

# Features
- Galactic forwarding.
  - The bot reads the [Shores of Hazeron Galactic chat](https://www.hazeron.com/indexnosplash.php) and writes it to a specified channel on the Discord server.
